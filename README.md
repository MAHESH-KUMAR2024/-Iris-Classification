# Iris-Classification

# Objective:

To build and evaluate classification models that can accurately predict the species of an Iris flower based on four input features:

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)

machine learning algorithms:

Decision Tree Classifier

Logistic Regression

# Dataset Description:

We use the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning introduced by Ronald Fisher. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers from 3 species:

Iris-setosa

Iris-versicolor

Iris-virginica

Each sample includes:

Sepal length (in cm)

Sepal width (in cm)

Petal length (in cm)

Petal width (in cm)

#  Approach:

Load the dataset using sklearn.datasets.load_iris()

Split the dataset into training and test sets (80/20 split)

Train two models:

Decision Tree Classifier

Logistic Regression

Make predictions on the test data

Evaluate performance using:

Accuracy

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

# Tools Used:

Python

scikit-learn (for models and dataset)

pandas (optional, for data handling)

train_test_split, accuracy_score, classification_report


# Expected Outcome:

You will observe that both classifiers perform well on this dataset.
You’ll gain practical understanding of how classification works.
You’ll be able to compare performance between different ML algorithms.
